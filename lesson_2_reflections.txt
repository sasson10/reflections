What happens when you initialize a repository? why do you need to do it?
Well, when you initialize a new repository you will see that your files 
appear like untracked files, because does not exist a previous history about them, and you need initialize this directory because you need 
create a .git directory that will contain the metadata into itself.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository ? what value do you think it offers? the staging area is like 
another directory but in this directory you have the posibility to put 
only the files taht you want and that is the special value.
